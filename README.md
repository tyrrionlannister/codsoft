1.CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED

RESPONSES

Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural

language processing and conversation flow.

2.TIC-TAC-TOE AI

Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with
or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.
This project will help you understand game theory and basic search

algorithms.
